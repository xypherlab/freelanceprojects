1. Fingerprint

-Fingerprint scanner has 4 pin out which is tx (transmit), rx (receive), vcc and gnd. 
-VCC is connected to +5V and GND is connected to ground.
-The tx of fingerprint is connected to rx of microcontroller pin 12
-The rx of fingerprint is connected to tx of microcontroller pin 14
-The type of communication used for this module is software serial
-This module is interfaced by microcontroller and the library used came from adafruit
-The interfaced functions of this module are recognition, registration, and deletion of fingerprint scanned.


2. SMS Module
-SMS Module has 4 pin out which is tx (transmit), rx (receive), vcc and gnd. 
-VCC is connected to +5V and GND is connected to ground.
-The tx of SMS Module is connected to rx of microcontroller pin 2
-The rx of SMS Module is connected to tx of microcontroller pin 3
-The type of communication used for this module is hardware serial
-This module is interfaced via AT Commands from the microcontroller
-The interfaced functions of this module are to read inbox and send message
-The information sent and received is relayed to raspberry pi via zigbee

3. Zigbee
-Zigbee has 4 pin out which is tx (transmit), rx (receive), vcc and gnd. 
-VCC is connected to +5V and GND is connected to ground.
-The tx of Zigbee 1 is connected to rx of microcontroller pin 10

-The rx of Zigbee 2 is connected to tx of raspberry pi pin 10
-The type of communication used for this module is hardware serial on raspberry pi and software serial on microcontroller
-The main function of this module is to transmit and received information coming and going between microcontroller and raspberry pi

4. Rasberry Pi
-This module is a pocket PC running Linux based operating system which responsible for processing the information and controlling the microcontroller to interface all modules needed in the whole system
-It is operated by a 5V 2A supply
-Python program was used in the Student Dormitory Monitoring System which is running on this module
-Reports and database are in CSV form

5. Atmega 328 (Microcontroller)
-The microcontroller is responsible for interfacing all the modules used in the system
-It is powered by 5V supply
-It only contains 1 hardware serial
-The rest of the module were interfaced using software serial
-The crystal oscillator connected in the microcontroller functions as a processor which operates the internal clock and responsible for continuous execution of the program.

6. PL2303
-Responsible for uploading the program in microcontroller
-It has 5 pin out which is tx (transmit), rx (receive), DTR, vcc and gnd. 
-DTR is directly connected to pin 1 of microcontroller. It functions as an auto reset for the program to be uploaded.
-The program is transmitted in microcontroller via serial communication type.

7. Power Supply
-The power source has 220V AC to 12V AC step down transformer 
-It has 1n4007 bridge rectifier to convert 12V AC to DC
-The 12V is then regulated into 5V by LM7805
